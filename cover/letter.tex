\opening{Dear IBM} 
 
\noindent IBM is the greatest company in the world, and as a programmer, becoming the member of IBM is always my dream. Now I'm trying to realize my dream by apply the co-op position of your company.

\noindent Programming is my first interesting when I was still a young boy. After about 10 years programming experience, including the zeal for writing code, I still have lots of other ability that makes me a good programmer. 

\noindent Learning and using new knowledge very fast. For my last two co-op term, there are lots of technology I have never have heard about. But I can get the idea of them and use them to do the real job in few weeks. And in the ACM/ICPC programming competition, I also once learned a new algorithm and implement it just in one hour. So I'm not afraid of something I don't know because I have confidence that I can learn it quickly. Secondly, as the member of ACM/ICPC team of SFU and ZJU, I have lots of ability that other people may not. Not only the knowledge of algorithm and data structure, the ability of reading and debugging other's program but also the consciousness of make the program efficient and beautiful. When code is slow, I know how to optimize it. And I also know it's very
important that the program shall be easy to read and maintained. And the other things including the sense of responsibility, the way of programming with other people, the ability of programming under great pressure, are all come from the experience of programming and join the competition.

\noindent So I believe my ability and skills can meet the requirement of IBM. Thank you for your time and I'm looking forward to hearing from you. 

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
