\opening{Dear IBM,} 
 
\noindent IBM is one of the greatest IT company in the world. As a programmer, becoming a member of IBM is always my dream. Now I'm trying to realize my dream by apply the co-op position.

\noindent Programming is my top interest since I was 14. With about 10 years programming experience, plus the zeal for writing code, I still have lots of other ability that makes me a fabulous programmer. 

\noindent I learn and use new knowledge very fast. When I was in RIM, as a developer for MVS system which is a telephone system for large company which there are lots of technology word like dtmf-tone or PSTN that I even never heard about it at the very beginning. And in MRX Solutions , I was asked to write code on Mac which I never tried before. However, I can always got the general graph of these new technologies and start my work quickly in 1 or 2 weeks. And in the ACM/ICPC programming competition, I also once learned a new algorithm and implement it just in one hour. So I'm not afraid of something I don't know because I have confidence that I can learn it quickly. 

\noindent I'm an active member of ACM/ICPC team since I entered the university. ACM/ICPC in the top algorithm competition for university students all over the world. The contestants not only need to find the solution of problem based on their knowledge of algorithm and data structure or the ability of writing and debugging code in a very short time but also need to know lots of other things like optimize the code based on different situation or explain your idea to you teammates. This famous competition attract all the students who love programming and challenge from every countries every year.

\noindent However, the most valuable thing I learned from the two co-op terms' experience and ACM/ICPC competition is the importance of team work. Teamwork is not just finding more people to solve a problem quickly, but more important, is supporting and helping each other so nobody will afraid of difficult.  Working with the smart people is a very enjoyable and I believe the IBM can give me such environment and my ability and skills can meet the requirement of IBM. Thank you for your time and I'm looking forward to hearing from you. 

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
